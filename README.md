This is an example Backbone app made for learning purposes. Firebase is used as the backend for the data.

Demo: [https://trasteos.firebaseapp.com/](https://trasteos.firebaseapp.com/)

## Dependencies

* [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/) instead of jQuery
* [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) instead of Underscore
* [Backbonefire](https://github.com/firebase/backbonefire) Backbone bindings for Firebase

## Future challenges

- [ ] Require login to add new logs
- [ ] Pick author name from auth data
- [ ] Only allow log deletion to its author
- [ ] Reduce the use of global variables
- [ ] Use [RequireJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/backbone.js/tutorials/organizing-backbone-using-modules "Organizing Backbone using Modules (require.js)") or maybe [another approach](https://bocoup.com/weblog/organizing-your-backbone-js-application-with-modules "Organizing Your Backbone.js Application With Modules")
